# README

This repository contains my project submissions on AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree course from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd189). This is a part of [AWS Machine Learning scholarship program](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/aws-machine-learning-scholarship-program), which begins with a Machine Learning foundation course. I put some ML foundation materials in this [repository](https://github.com/elvyna/udacity-aws-ml-foundation).
